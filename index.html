            Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to
            bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I
            do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the
            exact same way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get
            some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are
            connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite
            ends.
          </p>

          <p>
            You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has
            a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for
            murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I
            don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that
            seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we
            took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the
            snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but
            it doesn't hold a candle to man.

            so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you
            this case, it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through
            too much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your
            dumb ass.

            Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It
            all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you can tell who the
            arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And
            most times they're friends, like you and me! I should've known way
            back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. They called
            me Mr Glass.

            Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag
            clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a little
            Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a
            mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No?
            Well, that's what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're
            in a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant named
            Jeb.

            Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage don't
            make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwone into a glass
            motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger talks.
            Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause
            I'll kill the motherfucker, know what I'm sayin'?

            My money's in that office, right? If she start giving me some
            bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go someplace else and
            get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the head then and there. Then I'm
            gonna shoot that bitch in the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn
            money is. She gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to
            you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that nigga
            Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first motherfucker to
            get shot. You understand?

            You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has
            a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for
            murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I
            don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that
            seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we
            took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the
            snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but
            it doesn't hold a candle to man.

            Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami.
            This gun is advertised as the most popular gun in American crime. Do
            you believe that shit? It actually says that in the little book that
            comes with it: the most popular gun in American crime. Like they're
            actually proud of that shit.

            Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken,
            but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period
            so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you
            this case, it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through
            too much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your
            dumb ass.

            Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to
            bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I
            do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the
            exact same way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get
            some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are
            connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite
            ends.
